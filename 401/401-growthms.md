## Discussion Questions

### Emotional intelligence

Being in Code-Fellows and interacting with the same group of people daily has really helped me improve on my social awareness. I wasn't always socially unaware, but through years of covid I lost some of it. Being in professional enviroment everyday has helped me regain some of that and truly has been helpful. I've also grown considerably in my self-management, I didn't have the best routine before and the structure that Code fellows has provided has really help me stabilize and prioritize the import things.

### My Biases

I'd like to believe I've grown in this area considerably, throughout the past month i've made a conscious effort to really reflect on what I'm about to say and really consider the other person's situation before I say something. It's been rough for me in the past to put myself in another persons shoes and not immediately be biased in how I've experienced situations in the past. I strive to continue to grow in this area and become less of a biased person.
