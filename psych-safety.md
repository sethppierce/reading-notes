## What I learned

I learned some stuff that I have already experienced during my time in the Marine Corps, though it didn't always go down like the article said was the best practice. You weren't always in groups that accepted input from everyone and sometimes you were in groups where everyone was smart but wasn't at cooperating as a team and it was very difficult to get things done. You didn't have much say most of the time, and working in groups was always rough. Reading the assignment really opened my eyes as to why it was that way and how groups are supposed to be. Working that type of environment wasn't the greatest for my mental health and I hope going forward my future work environments are like some of the good examples from the reading assignment.
