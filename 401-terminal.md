## The Command Line - What is it, how does it work and how do I get to one

This section talked about the basic functionality of the terminal, and how to open it, I already knew this information but it was a good refresher.

## Basic Navigation - An introduction to the Linux directory system and how to get around it

This section showed and explained the basic `pwd cd ls` commands to navigate around your file system in the terminal.

- pwd - print working directory, shows current location
- cd - changes directory
- ls - lists all of the files inside of a folder.

It also discussed the two types of paths, relative and absolute.

relative - A file or directory location relative to where we currently are in the file system.

Absolute path - A file or directory location in relation to the root of the file system.

## More About Files - Find out some interesting characteristics of files and directories in a Linux environment

Everything is a file. This section explained more information about what files are and how the linux system treats a file. Noteable takeaways are that Linux is an extensionless system, and that it is case sensitive.

## Manual Pages - Learn how to make the most of the Linux commands you are learning

This section showed me something that I haven't seen yet, the manual! The manual has a list of commands that you can search using `man`, `man -k`, and `/<term>`.
This was very helpful, as I never knew of this command in the terminal.

## File Manipulation - How to make, remove, rename, copy and move files and directories

In this section, they described the commands to make a directory, delete a directory, create a blank file, copy a file, move a file, and to delete a file.

- mkdir - Make Directory - ie. Create a directory.
- rmdir - Remove Directory - ie. Delete a directory.
- touch - Create a blank file.
- cp - Copy a file or directory.
- mv -  Move a file or directory (can also be used to rename).
