## Questions

### How I explained REST to my brother

Who is Roy Fielding?- He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does.

Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?- because we only need to talk to a small group of machines

What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?- it uses GET, POST, PUT, and PATCH on our urls

What does a GET do?- gets information from our apis

What does a POST do?- creates new information on our apis

What does PUT do?- replaces old info with new info

What does PATCH do?- updates old info with new info

### API Keys

I recieved all of my API keys.
