## Expressions and operators

At a high level, an expression is a valid unit of code that resolves to a value. There are two types of expressions: those that have side effects (such as assigning values) and those that purely evaluate.

## Assignment operators

An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. The simple assignment operator is equal (=), which assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand.

## Assigning to properties

If an expression evaluates to an object, then the left-hand side of an assignment expression may make assignments to properties of that expression.

## Comparison operators

A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true. The operands can be numerical, string, logical, or object values.

## Loops and iteration

Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. All repeat an action a number of times, could be 0.

## For statement

A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.

## While statement

A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. Avoid infinite loops. Make sure the condition in a loop eventually becomes falseâ€”otherwise, the loop will never terminate.
