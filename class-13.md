## Questions

### Why this matters

This matters because if we want to use data on a different page or want the user's data to be stored we need to use local storage for now.

### Local Storage and How To Use It On Websites

Why would a developer use local storage for a web application?
For data to persist locally if user refreshed or went to a different page and wanted to use the information there.

What information should not be stored in local storage?
Personal information, passwords, SSNs

Local storage can store what type of data? How would you convert it to that type before storing?

its stored as strings and can be worked around with JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse().
