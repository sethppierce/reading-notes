### What a growth mindset is to me.
I believe a growth mindset is about being able to be flexible and presistent in learning whenever you find something difficult or confusing. 

- **NOT EVERYONE IS AN EXPERT** We are still learning!
- **DON'T TAKE CRITICISM TO HEART** Criticism helps you realize your flaws and how to improve them!
- ***EMBRACE THE CHALLENGE!!!***
