## Discussion Questions

### What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

I think that my love of learning new things is one of my biggest assets. I'm always looking to learn new things to improve myself, and I think this would be valuable because the tech industry is always changing and evolving.

### What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

1. I need to start abiding by the 15 minute rule. I struggle with this a lot, I will stare at a problem until it is solved right now and it's not the greatest way to handle things.
2. Take the problem on step by step, and put things together in the end. Looking at the bigger problem can get frustrating and be a lot to think about at one time, breaking it down can really help me put together everything.
3. ASK QUESTIONS. I'll start asking more questions when I really can't figure it out instead of being stubborn and just trying to force my way through a problem.
