### [What is a Text editor?](https://codefellows.github.io/code-102-guide/curriculum/class-02/Choosing-A-Text-Editor--The-Older-Coder.pdf)

A text editor is an important piece of software used to manage the text used in your code. Text editors generally have feautures that allow you to have a lot of customization and make your work more efficient. You can either use the text editor that comes with your OS or download a third party application.

#### Difference between text editors and IDEs-

Text editor-edits text and manages text and files.
IDE(Intergrated Development Environment)- text editor, a file manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package.

### [The Command Line!](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/commandline.php)

#### So what are they exactly?

A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.

#### Opening a Terminal

If you're on a Mac then you'll find the program Terminal under Applications -> Utilities. An easy way to get to it is the key combination 'command + space' which will bring up Spotlight, then start typing Terminal and it will soon show up.
If on Linux then you will probably find it in Applications -> System or Applications -> Utilities. Alternatively you may be able to 'right-click' on the desktop and there may be an option 'Open in terminal'.
If you are on Windows and intend to remotely log into another machine then you will need an SSH client.
