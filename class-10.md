## Questions

### Why this matters

If we are going to learn how to write the code we have to learn what breaks it and how to fix it.

### What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript

Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error. syntax errors are spelling errors that cause programs not to run but logic errors have correct syntax but the code doesn't work the way you intended.
List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them. I have had tons of syntaxs errors that were pretty easy to fix, but I had some problems when adding new rows and the totals being added in the footer, I was able to fix it because I found one of the key variables I was using wasn't globally scoped.
How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals? I realize that I will always encounter errors, I just need to continue to get better at seeing and fixing them.

### The JavaScript Debugger

How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?  It allows you to see whats being outputted and if theres an error it shows you where it occurs.
Define what a breakpoint is. a stop you can put in your code that only executes until that point.
What is the call stack?  The Call stack section shows you what code was executed to get to the current line.
