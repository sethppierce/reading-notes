# JavaScript

[Return to Home](https://sethppierce.github.io/reading-notes)

JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. Most known scripting language for web pages.

## What are Variables?

Variables are containers for storing data (storing data values).
Variables are used for holding values and are used in expressions.
Declare using var, let, or const

- var- used in older browsers
- let- newer, the keyword we will be using
- const- declares a variable that can't be changed

## JavaScript Identifiers

All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names, called identifiers.
Identifiers are case sensitive.

- Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
- Names must begin with a letter
- Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)
- Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)
- Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.

## JavaScript Data Types

JavaScript variables can hold numbers like 100 and text values like "John Doe".
Text values are called strings, using quotes.
Number values are written without quotes.

## Value = undefined

In computer programs, variables are often declared without a value. The value can be something that has to be calculated, or something that will be provided later, like user input.
