## Questions

### Why this matters

It's important to know how CSS elements are laid out at first so we can learn how to change that and get it to be laid out in the way we want it to be. Functions are super important because without them we woudld have to re-write code anytime we wanted to do something.

### Creating Hyperlinks

2. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument? parameter is used when declaring the function and arguments are the parameters used when calling a function.

### 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.

- engaged cooperation - Learning from one another is going to be a big way we grow in coding and help us understand things that we may not by someone offering a different perspective on how things work.
- Learning from fellow students- some people might know things that I might not know or different ways to do things that are more efficient that I don't know. It goes the other way as well with me, I might know things or different ways to do things that my fellow classmates might not know, and sharing that information only serves to help us all grow.
